# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Enables the workflow to be triggered manually
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "simple"
  simple:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo password




# Exercise 1 tasks:
# 1 Add a trigger to manually run the workflow
# 2 Take our password here and put it into a secret and replace it in the workflow with the correct reference
# 3 Create an additional job that will create a simple string output to use in subsequent jobs
# 4 Create another additional job that uses a matrix strategy and will print "<output from previous job>-<numbers 1-10, one at a time>"
